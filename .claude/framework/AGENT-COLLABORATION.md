# Agent-to-Agent Collaboration Framework

**Multi-agent session management** and coordination patterns for professional collaborative development.

## Session Management Architecture

### Session Structure
```yaml
session:
  id: "unique-session-identifier"
  type: "feature_implementation | refactoring | bug_fixing | learning | code_review"
  participants: ["agent-identifiers", "assigned-roles"]
  context: "shared-context-and-state"
  progress: "current-phase-and-completion-status"
  quality_gates: "validation-checkpoints"
```

## Collaboration Patterns

### Pair Programming (`/pair --start`)
**Pattern**: Navigator provides strategic guidance while Driver implements

**Communication Flow**:
- **Continuous Dialogue**: Ongoing discussion of approach and implementation
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time code review and quality guidance
- **Shared Decision Making**: Collaborative problem solving and solution design
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Learning exchange and skill development

**Benefits**:
- Immediate code quality improvement through real-time review
- Knowledge sharing and skill development for both participants
- Reduced defects through collaborative problem solving
- Enhanced understanding of BDD scenarios and customer requirements

**Process**:
1. Navigator guides overall approach and architecture decisions
2. Driver implements specific code following guidance
3. Continuous dialogue ensures shared understanding
4. Real-time review prevents defects and maintains quality

### Role Switching (`/pair --navigate` | `/pair --drive`)
**Triggers**:
- Task complexity changes requiring different expertise
- Knowledge area shifts (frontend ↔ backend ↔ testing)
- Learning opportunities for skill development
- Natural breakpoints in development workflow (TDD cycles)

**Process**:
1. Recognize need for role transition
2. Complete current micro-task (test cycle, feature implementation)
3. Conduct context handoff with current state and decisions
4. Execute role transition with clear responsibility assignment
5. Resume collaboration with new role assignments

**Frequency**: 
- Natural breakpoints: TDD cycle completion, feature milestones
- Time-based: 15-30 minute intervals for engagement
- Context-driven: When expertise requirements change

**Benefits**:
- Skill development through diverse role experience
- Maintained engagement and focus through variety
- Perspective diversity improving solution quality
- Knowledge distribution across team members

### Real-Time Code Review
**Pattern**: Quality feedback during development, not after completion

**Timing**: During implementation phase, integrated with coding process

**Focus Areas**:
- Architecture adherence and design pattern application
- Quality standards compliance and best practice usage
- BDD scenario alignment and customer value validation
- Performance, security, and maintainability considerations

**Outcome**:
- Higher quality code through immediate corrections
- Reduced technical debt through proactive quality management
- Enhanced learning through real-time knowledge transfer
- Faster delivery through early defect prevention

## Communication Protocols

### Navigator Communication Standards
- **Strategic Guidance**: "Let's architect this to handle the scaling requirements from AC-3"
- **Quality Feedback**: "This implementation could be more testable if we extract the validation logic"
- **Problem Solving**: "I see three approaches here - let's consider the trade-offs"
- **Knowledge Sharing**: "This pattern worked well in similar scenarios because..."

### Driver Communication Standards
- **Implementation Updates**: "Completed the login validation, all tests passing"
- **Clarification Requests**: "Should this handle the edge case mentioned in scenario 2?"
- **Problem Identification**: "I'm seeing a dependency issue with the authentication service"
- **Learning Documentation**: "I learned that this approach handles async validation better"

### Coordinator Communication Standards
- **Session Management**: "We're 60% through the feature, on track for completion"
- **Role Coordination**: "Time for role switch - Driver, please handoff current context"
- **Context Preservation**: "Key decision: we chose approach B because of performance requirements"
- **Workflow Optimization**: "Let's adjust our TDD cycle timing to match integration points"
