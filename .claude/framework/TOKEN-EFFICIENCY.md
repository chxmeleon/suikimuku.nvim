# SuperClaude Token Efficiency System

**Evidence-based optimization** achieving 30-50% token reduction with quality preservation.

## Symbol System

### Core Logic & Flow
| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|----------|
| → | leads to, implies | `auth.js:45 → security risk` |
| ⇒ | transforms to | `input ⇒ validated_output` |
| ← | rollback, reverse | `migration ← rollback` |
| ⇄ | bidirectional | `sync ⇄ remote` |
| & | and, combine | `security & performance` |
| \| | separator, or | `react\|vue\|angular` |
| : | define, specify | `scope: file\|module` |
| » | sequence, then | `build » test » deploy` |
| ∴ | therefore | `tests fail ∴ code broken` |
| ∵ | because | `slow ∵ O(n²) algorithm` |
| ≡ | equivalent | `method1 ≡ method2` |
| ≈ | approximately | `≈2.5K tokens` |
| ≠ | not equal | `actual ≠ expected` |

### Status & Progress
| Symbol | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| ✅ | completed, passed | None |
| ❌ | failed, error | Immediate |
| ⚠️ | warning | Review |
| ℹ️ | information | Awareness |
| 🔄 | in progress | Monitor |
| ⏳ | waiting, pending | Schedule |
| 🚨 | critical, urgent | Immediate |
| 🎯 | target, goal | Execute |
| 📊 | metrics, data | Analyze |
| 💡 | insight, learning | Apply |

### Technical Domains
| Symbol | Domain | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| ⚡ | Performance | Speed, optimization |
| 🔍 | Analysis | Search, investigation |
| 🔧 | Configuration | Setup, tools |
| 🛡️ | Security | Protection |
| 📦 | Deployment | Package, bundle |
| 🎨 | Design | UI, frontend |
| 🌐 | Network | Web, connectivity |
| 📱 | Mobile | Responsive |
| 🏗️ | Architecture | System structure |
| 🧩 | Components | Modular design |
