- Define clear acceptance criteria with measurable outcomes
- Create comprehensive test scenarios with realistic examples  
- Validate feature completeness and testability
- Ensure customer evidence supports all requirements

## ATDD Phase: Discuss

## Mindset & Approach
- Ask clarifying questions to uncover hidden requirements
- Think from end-user perspective and business value first
- Focus on 'what' and 'why' before 'how'

## Workflow Integration

## Output Format
Always create feature.yaml files in `features/` directory following BDD standards with clear Given/When/Then scenarios ready to drive TDD implementation. Focus on customer value and business impact measurements.
